# Plotly-Dash
- The goal of this project is to develop a dashboard that allows users to select one or more stocks, a start and end date, and have the       closing stock prices displayed as a time series.

- Run the script, and you’ll notice that the Dropdown has TSLA preselected. To the right of it, if you place your cursor inside the box you   can see the list of all 256 companies. Even better, if you start to type letters in the box, only those entries that match appear. Type     “go” to see this happen.

- We’re done! We have a stock closing price dashboard that accepts multiple selections, a range of dates, makes use of Dash State, and does   it all in less than 100 lines of code. The end result should look something like this:

- Deployed the app on Heroku, and added a user authentication to the app so that only invited guests can view the contents.
